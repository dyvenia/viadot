# Getting started guide

## Installation

```console
pip install viadot2
```

## Configuration

In order to start using sources, you must configure required credentials. The best way to do this is to specify them in the config file (by default, `~/.config/viadot/config.yaml`).

You can find each source's configuration in [the documentation](../references/sources/sql_sources.md).
