        A task for querying SAP with SQL using the RFC protocol.

        Note that only a very limited subset of SQL is supported:
        - aliases
        - where clauses combined using the AND operator
        - limit & offset

        Unsupported:
        - aggregations
        - joins
        - subqueries
        - etc.

        Args:
            query (str, optional): The query to be executed with pyRFC.
            sep (str, optional): The separator to use when reading query results. If not provided,
            multiple options are automatically tried. Defaults to None.
            func (str, optional): SAP RFC function to use. Defaults to None.
            rfc_total_col_width_character_limit (int, optional): Number of characters by which query will be split in chunks
            in case of too many columns for RFC function. According to SAP documentation, the limit is
            512 characters. However, we observed SAP raising an exception even on a slightly lower number
            of characters, so we add a safety margin. Defaults to 400.
            credentials (dict, optional): The credentials to use to authenticate with SAP.
            By default, they're taken from the local viadot config.
