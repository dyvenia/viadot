    """Runs dbt commands within a shell.

    Args:
        command: dbt command to be executed; can also be provided post-initialization
            by calling this task instance.
        project_path: The path to the dbt project.
        env: Dictionary of environment variables to use for the subprocess; can also be
            provided at runtime.
        shell: Shell to run the command with.
        return_all: Whether this task should return all lines of stdout as a list, or
            just the last line as a string.
        stream_level: The logging level of the stream; defaults to 20, equivalent to
            `logging.INFO`.
        raise_on_failure: Whether to fail the task if the command fails.

    Returns:
        If return all, returns all lines as a list; else the last line as a string.

    Example:
        Executes `dbt run` on a specified dbt project.
        ```python
        from prefect import flow
        from viadot.tasks import dbt_task

        PROJECT_PATH = "/home/viadot/dbt/my_dbt_project"
