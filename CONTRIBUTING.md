# How to contribute to `viadot`

## Setting up the environment

### VSCode

We provide the extensions, settings, and tasks for VSCode in the `.vscode` folder.

1. Install the extensions
   ```bash
   cd .vscode && sh install_extensions.sh && cd ..
   ```
2. Open the project in VSCode
   ```bash
    code .
   ```
3. Open terminals

   In VSCode, run `Ctrl+Shift+B` to open two terminal windows: a local `bash` one and a `viadot_2` container one.

### Environment variables

To run tests, you may need to set up some environment variables or the viadot config. You can find all the required environment variables in the [tests' dotenv file](./tests/.env.example), and all the required viadot config settings in the [config file](./config.yaml.example). We're working on making this process easier, so only one of these can be used.

## Style guidelines

- code should be formatted with `black` using default settings (easiest way is to use the VSCode extension)
- imports should be sorted using `isort`
- commit messages should:
  - begin with an emoji
  - start with one of the following verbs, capitalized, immediately after the summary emoji: "Add", "Update", "Remove", "Fix", "Rename", and, sporadically, other ones, such as "Upgrade", "Downgrade", or whatever you find relevant for your particular situation
  - contain a useful summary of what the commit is doing
    See [this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/) to understand basics of naming commits
